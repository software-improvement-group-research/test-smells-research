<h1>You're invited to participate in our research!</h1>

At Software Improvement Group, we're constantly looking for ways to
help you improve your code. We have a very active software engineering
research department working with Universities from around the
world. One of the fields of interest is the quality of test code. And
we'd like to invite you to help us validate our research. Our research
partner for this topic is the University of Amsterdam, The
Netherlands.

*"Detecting relevant test smells will help you to get better insight
into the quality of your test code." - Martin Schvarcbacher*

## What types of test smells are detected?
We detect in your Java code the following test smells: Assertion
roulette, conditional test logic, eager tests, general fixture, magic
number tests, mystery guest, resource optimism, sleepy tests, verbose
tests, ignored tests and empty tests.

## How to participate?
Our researchers have created an incubator version of Better Code Hub
(BCH). In this special version, they've changed the Automate Tests
guideline to detect Test Smells. This concept is similar to code
smells in production, but now we've applied it to unit tests in Java
code. We invite you to run multiple BCH analyses on your Java code and
help the research by validating the results.

## How to use the BCH incubator?

To sum up...
1. Visit the incubator version of Better Code Hub at
   https://incubator.sig.eu/TEST-SMELLS/
1. Log in with your Github account and accept the two security scopes
   for the new GitHub OAuth app on first use.
1. After running an analysis and clicking on the first guideline
   "RESEARCH: Adding Test Quality Metrics to Automate Tests", you will
   see a list of test smells in your project if they exist ;-)
1. Please validate our detection of the test smells by providing
   feedback via an ultra short survey for each test smell finding.
1. Don't forget to complete your user profile at
   https://incubator.sig.eu/TEST-SMELLS/user-profile, this will help
   us understand your experience level.

## What's in it for you?
- As a token of our appreciation, you'll be given an Individual
  license for the duration of the research. This allows you to analyse
  your personal public and private repositories along with public
  organisation repositories with the incubator version of Better Code
  Hub.
- Sorry, Java only ;-)
- Currently the test smell detection works only on Java source
  code. If you would like to help with this research and donâ€™t have
  any Java projects, you can fork some of the well-known Java projects
  to your GitHub profile and run the analysis on them. Some projects
  you could use:
 
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework

https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava

https://github.com/mockito/mockito
